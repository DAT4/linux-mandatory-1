# Installation manager

This script is giving a user the options to try to install programs on his linux machine. 

_At the moment some parts of the script will only work on Ubuntu/Debian based distrobutions_

The script is using Whiptail to show a nice presentation of the options that the user will get during the process of installing.

Possible options:

* Install from github/source (implemented)
* Install from package manager (implemented)
* Install from deb file (not implemented)
* Install from tarball (not implemented)
* Uninstall (not implemented)

## Install from github/source (implemented)
It is possible to write a github link and get the sourcecode from the authors main branch. Then it will be installed to `/usr/local/bin`

## Install from package manager (implemented)

## Install from deb file (not implemented)

## Install from tarball (not implemented)

## Uninstall (not implemented)
