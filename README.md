# Installation manager

This script is giving a user the options to try to install programs on his linux machine. 

_At the moment some parts of the script will only work on Ubuntu/Debian based distrobutions_

The script is using Whiptail to show a nice presentation of the options that the user will get during the process of installing.

Possible options:

* Install from github/source (implemented)
* Install from package manager (implemented)
* Install from deb file (not implemented)
* Install from tarball (implemented)
* Uninstall (not implemented)
